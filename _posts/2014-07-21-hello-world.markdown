We're very excited - not just because of the inordinate amount of caffeine based products consumed -
but also because our team are putting together
the final missing parts to the biggest Google related event in Paris - [GDG DevFest 2015](http://devfest.gdgparis.com/).

So should you also be excited ? Well yes... and here's why!

* **Attendance**: we're expecting over 300 attendees
* **Topic**: more than 20 hours of pure Google technologies
* **Date**: 28 of November
* **Speakers**: we're in the process of finalising the list of speakers

but we've already secured a first batch of experts:

* **Didier Girard Ostrowski** - Google Developer Expert in Google Cloud Platform<br>
* **David Gageot** - Google Developer Expert in Google Cloud Platform<br>
* **Romain Vialard** - Google Developer Expert in Google Apps Script<br>
* **Eyal Lezmy** - Google Developer Expert in Android and member of the Paris Android User Group<br>
