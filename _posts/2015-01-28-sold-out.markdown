All DevFest tickets are now sold !
We will be more than 300 technology enthusiasts for the event.

We will meet the lucky ones who have been able to buy their tickets this Friday.
If you are not able to attend, all sessions will be recorded and you will be able to watch them after the event.

We also hope to see you at our Meetups we organize throughout the year and, probably, for another DevFest next year.
